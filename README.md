# Cpx_FeMg_diffusion_calculator
This repository provides supplementary MATLAB codes for calculating Fe-Mg interdiffusion in clinopyroxene of igneous samples.



## **Note on Data and Code Availability for Wang et al. (2023)**

At the time of publication of *"Cooling rate of clinopyroxene reveals the thickness and effusion volume of Chang’E-5 basaltic flow units"* (Wang et al., 2023), the author, due to limited experience and a lack of understanding of standard academic publishing practices, did not make the key datasets and calculation codes publicly available. This omission was an oversight, and the author acknowledges this as a mistake.

To rectify this, a folder titled *"Supplementary Code for Wang et al. (2023) Icarus"* has been created, containing the original data and scripts used in the study. These materials are now openly accessible for reference and reproducibility.

It is important to note that, while the methods used in the original study are not fundamentally flawed, several aspects—such as curve fitting procedures, selection of initial conditions, and the assumption of linear cooling—are recognized as overly simplistic in hindsight. As such, the reported cooling rates in Wang et al. (2023) likely have significant scope for refinement.

The author is currently working to re-quantify the cooling history of Chang’E-5 basalts using updated diffusion modeling techniques. The improved methods, along with revised code and results, will be published in this repository as they become available. Constructive feedback and critical review from readers are highly encouraged and welcomed!
